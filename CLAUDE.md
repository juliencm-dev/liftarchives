# CLAUDE.md

**IMPORTANT: Read `AGENT.md` at the start of every session.** It contains hard-won lessons from previous agents — shell gotchas, repo conventions, and patterns you must follow. Ignoring it will cause repeated mistakes.

If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you, please alert the developer working with you and document it in `AGENT.md` to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.
